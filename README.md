###Project Notes

This is one of my first web pages and represents my first time experimenting with Bootstrap. It was fun!

####Strengths:
* I think I did a good job formatting the photos and experimenting with several of the different options Bootstrap offers
* I figured out how to break up content on a single-page site
* I figured out how to put together a color scheme

####Things to Improve:
* I need to work on responsive design and making things scale in a way that is appealing across screen sizes
* The layout of content might be a bit dull/repetitive. Maybe mix up the fonts more?
* I'd like to add some jQuery effects (maybe scrolling effects?)

I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people. Feel free to contact me if you want to learn together!
